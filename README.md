# 🍽️ Restaurant-Rating-Predictor
This repository contains a web application that predicts restaurant ratings based on various features, such as reviews, location, or cuisine. Built with Flask for a responsive web interface and leveraging machine learning for predictive modeling, this project showcases expertise in data science, web development, and application deployment.
📖 Overview
The Restaurant Rating Predictor is a machine learning-driven web application that estimates restaurant ratings using a trained model. The Flask-based interface allows users to input relevant features and receive rating predictions through a clean, responsive UI. The project includes a models folder for storing the trained model and is structured for easy deployment and scalability.
🎯 Features

Predicts restaurant ratings based on features like reviews, location, or cuisine.
Responsive web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
Supports user input for rating prediction through an intuitive UI.
Includes a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
Modular codebase for easy maintenance and experimentation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Lightweight framework for building the web application.
Scikit-learn: For training and serving the rating prediction model (assumed).
Pandas/NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
HTML/CSS: For front-end UI (in templates and static folders).
Gunicorn: WSGI server for deployment (assumed for potential deployment).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Restaurant-Rating-Predictor.git
cd Restaurant-Rating-Predictor


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure the trained model (in the models folder) is properly configured.

Usage

Run the Flask application locally:python app.py


Access the app at http://localhost:5000.


Input restaurant features (e.g., review scores, location) via the web UI to get rating predictions.
Explore the models folder for details on the trained model and its implementation.

🔍 How It Works

Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset of restaurant features (e.g., review scores, location, cuisine), likely stored or referenced in the models folder.
Model: A machine learning model (e.g., regression or classification) predicts restaurant ratings based on input features.
Web UI: The app.py script uses Flask to serve a web interface, with HTML templates in templates and styling in static.
Prediction Logic: The model in the models folder processes user inputs and returns predicted ratings through the Flask app.
